# Guitar Tutor

Just something to make my life easier as I try to memorize the note names on the right side of the fretboard. Because to me, the right side of the fretboard past the G on the first string is SCARY. 

## Start with defaults
```
GuitarTutor.new.start
```

## Pass in params
```
GuitarTutor.new(
    number_of_notes: 50,
    seconds_between_notes: 2
).start
```

Play the string printed out on the console. Repeat.
